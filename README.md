Not sure what im going to use this repo for; likely storing my DOTFiles for vim and my linux distro aswell as brainstorming ideas. the structure will likely be:

-----------------------Main--------------------------
consistant files i use daily in a "stable" state so to speak.
info for projects im activly working on or towards.

---------------------Main-Thoughts----------------------
small tests
discussions
experemental versions of files
thoughts for new projects
general notes
